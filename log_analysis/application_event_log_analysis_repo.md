1. File Overview and Meaning
1.1 What is the Application Event Log?

The Windows Application Event Log records events generated by applications and user-mode services. These events include application errors, crashes, warnings, and informational messages.

This log provides visibility into:

Application stability issues

Software failures and misconfigurations

Security-relevant application behavior

Although primarily operational, application logs often contain early indicators of compromise.

1.2 Purpose and Importance

Application Event Logs are important because they:

Detect abnormal application behavior

Reveal exploitation attempts against software

Support incident timeline reconstruction

Assist in root cause analysis of failures

Malware frequently generates application-level errors before being detected.
