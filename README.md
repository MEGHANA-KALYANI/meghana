# 💻 MEGHANA KALYANI – Cybersecurity & Log Analysis Internship Work

Welcome to my **Internship Progress & Task Repository**, where I’ve documented my work on system and security log analysis as part of my cybersecurity internship.

This repository contains:
- Structured analysis tasks
- Forensic-style technical reports
- Collected artifacts
- Command outputs from audited Windows systems

It serves as both a **project portfolio** and a **daily progress tracker** that reflects practical learning and real-world security analysis.
