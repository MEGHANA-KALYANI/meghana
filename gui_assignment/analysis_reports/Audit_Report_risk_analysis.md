## 1. Overview

This folder consolidates **risk-focused observations** derived from multiple audit artifacts, including system logs, security configurations, persistence mechanisms, and user activity.

Rather than containing raw logs, this folder represents **analytical interpretation and contextual risk assessment**.

---

## 2. Purpose and Importance

Risk analysis serves to:

- Identify potential security weaknesses  
- Highlight anomalous or high-risk behaviors  
- Prioritize findings based on impact and likelihood  
- Support decision-making for remediation or monitoring  

This layer bridges the gap between raw data and actionable insight.

---

## 3. Risk Categories Evaluated

The analysis considers risks across multiple domains, including:

- Authentication and access control  
- Persistence and auto-start mechanisms  
- Script and process execution behavior  
- Network exposure and connectivity  
- User activity patterns  

Each risk is evaluated in context, avoiding assumptions without supporting evidence.

---

## 4. Methodology

Risk assessments are derived by:

- Correlating multiple artifacts  
- Comparing observed behavior to expected baselines  
- Identifying deviations from normal system operation  
- Applying common threat modeling principles  

---

## 5. Summary

The risk analysis artifacts provide a **high-level security posture assessment** based on observed data. Identified risks are contextual and informational, supporting further investigation or validation where required.
